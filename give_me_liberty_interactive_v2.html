    <div class="segment" data-delay="0">The famous speech of Patrick Henry to the Virginia House of Burgesses, given on March 23, 1775, and entitled,</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="1">Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="2">No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="3">But different men often see the same subject in different lights, and therefore I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen,</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="4">if, entertaining as I do, opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="5">This is no time for ceremony.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="6">The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="7">For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery, and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="8">It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="9">Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason toward my country,</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="10">and of an act of disloyalty towards the majesty of heaven which I revere above all earthly kings.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="11">Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="12">We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="13">Is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="14">Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not,</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="15">the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="16">For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="17">I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="18">I know of no way of judging of the future, but by the past.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="19">And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British Ministry for the last ten years,</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="20">to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="21">Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="22">Trust it not, sir, it will prove a snare to your feet.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="23">Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="24">Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="25">Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="26">Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="27">Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="28">These are the implements of war and subjugation, the last arguments to which kings resort.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="29">I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="30">Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="31">Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="32">No, sir, she has none.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="33">They are meant for us that can be meant for no other.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="34">They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British Ministry have been so long forging.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="35">And what have we to oppose to them?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="36">Shall we try argument?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="37">Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="38">Have we anything new to offer upon this subject?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="39">Nothing.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="40">We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable, but it has all been in vain.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="41">Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="42">What terms shall we find which have not already been exhausted?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="43">Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="44">Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="45">We have petitioned.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="46">We have remonstrated.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="47">We have supplicated.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="48">We have prostrated ourselves before the throne.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="49">And have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="50">Our petitions have been slighted.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="51">Our remonstrant has produced additional violence and insult.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="52">Our supplications have been disregarded.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="53">And we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="54">In vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="55">There is no longer any room for hope.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="56">If we wish to be free.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="57">If we mean to preserve in violet those inestimable privileges for which we have so long been contending.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="58">If we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have so long been engaged.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="59">And which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="60">We must fight.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="61">I repeat it sir.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="62">We must fight.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="63">An appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that has left us.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="64">They tell us sir that we are weak.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="65">Unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="66">But when shall we be stronger?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="67">Will it be the next week?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="68">Or the next year?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="69">Will it be when we are totally disarmed?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="70">And when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="71">Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="72">Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="73">Until our enemies shall have us bound hand and foot?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="74">Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature hath placed in our power.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="75">The millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="76">Are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="77">Besides sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="78">There is a just god who presides over the destinies of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="79">The battle sir is not to the strong alone.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="80">It is to the vigilant, the active and the brave.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="81">Besides sir, we have no election.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="82">If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="83">There is no retreat but in submission and slavery.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="84">Our chains are forged.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="85">Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="86">The war is inevitable and let it come.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="87">I repeat it sir, let it come.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="88">It is in vain sir to extenuate the matter.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="89">Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="90">The war is actually begun.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="91">The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="92">Our brethren are already in the field.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="93">Why stand we here idle?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="94">What is it that gentlemen wish?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="95">What would they have?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="96">Is life so dear or peace so sweet?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="97">As to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="98">Forbid it Almighty God.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="99">I know not what course others may take.</div>
<div class="segment" data-delay="100">But as for me, give me liberty or give me death.</div>
